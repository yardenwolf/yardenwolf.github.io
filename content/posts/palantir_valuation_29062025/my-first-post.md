## Company overview

Palantir is a software company that integrates AI and smart analytics into SaaS products. It offers a range of products such as orchestration tools, automation, and analytics, all of which are done using AI. Their client base comprises government agencies (intelligence, defense etc.) and commercial clients.

## Investment Thesis

**Recommendation:** Sell  
Palantir’s current market value implies very aggressive future growth and geopolitical tailwinds which are not sustainable in the long run, suggesting a correction risk.  

**Target Price:** $51.86 PPS  
**Current Price:** $130 (As of 28/06/2025)

## Business Model

Palantir relies mainly on its ability to execute massive and complicated customized projects at scale, and so it focuses on big contracts such as government contracts. Palantir focuses on these for several reasons: the barrier to entry for executing these contracts is very high both from the contractor (Palantir) and the client. This ensures that smaller companies cannot compete well and that Palantir will likely be chosen for future projects. Additionally, Palantir likely relies heavily on revenues from existing long-term projects.

## Revenue segments and geographies

- 55% revenues from government
- 45% from commercial
- 66% from US based customers

## Recent performance / share price trends

Over the last year, Palantir’s PPS has climbed significantly, with the exception of a dip due to Trump’s tariff plan. On 21/06/2024 Palantir’s stock was trading around $25, and as of June it is trading at around $130 PPS. Following Trump’s tariff announcement, Palantir’s stock dropped to a low of around $80 – a level still well above its fundamental value.

## Capital Structure

Last quarter, Palantir paid off all its outstanding debt and now holds no interest-bearing debt on its balance sheet, apart from lease obligations (which may be viewed as debt under certain frameworks). As a result, a two-stage WACC approach was employed in the valuation. While being debt-free lowers financial risk, most mature companies maintain some level of debt to optimize their capital structure and enhance returns. Debt can serve as a growth catalyst by increasing the capital available for investment and provides a tax shield, which improves after-tax cash flows.  

Palantir’s recent growth has been strong, but we believe its ability to sustain this growth without any leverage is limited. In our model, we assume a gradual increase in Palantir’s debt capacity over time. We begin with a low initial debt-to-equity ratio of 0.04 and transition to a more normalized terminal ratio of 0.33, which results in a declining WACC from 12.58% in the near term to 5.64% in the long term. Increasing leverage not only supports growth but also reduces the overall WACC, which lifts the valuation. This further demonstrates that Palantir is overvalued.

## Valuation Summary

As the target price ended up being much lower than the market price, I did both a DCF and a multiples valuation for comparison, with the DCF having very optimistic financial assumptions and favourable market conditions. Both analyses show that Palantir’s market value is still very high compared to its fundamentals. I believe that the market is overly bullish about Palantir, but this isn’t an anomaly in a world dominated by the current AI bubble which will likely explode when AI becomes more prevalent and cheaper to deploy and create.

## DCF assumptions & Results

**Assumptions:**
- Model Structure – Two-stage growth
- Revenue Growth Assumptions: 40% growth rate, terminal growth rate of 3% (similar to nominal GDP growth rate)
- Tax Rate – starts at effective tax rate of 3.69% and converges to marginal tax rate of 25% in the US
- Risk Free Rate – Starts at 4.41% (yield of 10-year T-Bill), and terminal value of 2%, as I believe the risk-free rate is likely to go down  

**Results:**  
- **Bull Case (40% growth)**  
  - PV of CFs: 12.341B  
  - PV of Terminal Value: 107.724B  
  - Enterprise Value: 120.066B  
  - Net Cash: 2.571B  
  - Net Debt: 0.266B  
  - Equity Value: 122.370B  
  - Shares Outstanding: 2.359B  
  - Implied PPS: $51.86  

Under my current DCF model, to achieve Palantir’s current market value (circa $130), Palantir needs to exhibit a growth rate of around 60% in the next few years.

## Multiples Valuation

Given the low share price indicated by the DCF model, I decided to use the multiples valuation method as well just as a validation that I’m in the correct ballpark. To ensure the valuation was as close as possible to the current financials of the firm I used the EV/Revenue and not EV/EBITDA, as my DCF already models EBITDA. This ensures two orthogonal approaches for Palantir’s EV.  

To obtain an industry average I used the following comparable companies:
- **Snowflake (NYSE: SNOW)** – Offers cloud native data platform that enables storage, processing and analysis of large volumes of structured and semi-structured data. Snowflake deals with complex enterprise data, focusing on accessibility and usability at scale.
- **Datadog (NASDAQ: DDOG)** – Provides SaaS monitoring platforms for cloud applications. Datadog supports enterprises in managing and interpreting complex systems at scale, though Palantir focuses more on data analytics while Datadog more on monitoring cloud services.
- **Crowdstrike (NASDAQ: CRWD)** – Delivers cloud-native endpoint security and offers threat intelligence and threat hunting services. Operates in government and enterprise spaces and uses advanced AI and analytics.

All the above companies are traded in dollars as well. This was particularly important as Palantir is also traded in dollars.  

According to the multiples valuation, PPS is 27.19.

## Why is the fair value so different from the market value?

As mentioned previously, about a year ago Palantir’s market value was much closer to its fair value valuation. Palantir relies heavily on government contracts and has quite a lot of military partnerships. Over the last year, many ongoing conflicts have continued or escalated, increasing defence investment and accentuating the role AI might play in the modern battlefield. These conflicts started before the huge increase in Palantir’s share price, which raises the question of why Palantir’s stock price surge didn’t start earlier. As Palantir’s expertise is with defence partnerships and recent geopolitical events together with a reported partnership with the IDF and recent successes on the battlefield, this information was translated into a surge in demand for Palantir’s stock.
