Hi, I’m Yarden Wolf. I hold an **MSc in Financial Engineering (Distinction)** from *Imperial College London* and a **BSc in Computer Science with a minor in Economics** from *the Technion*.

I’m passionate about both private and public markets, with particular interest in **private debt**, **private equity**, **alternative investments**, and **quantitative approaches** to understanding macroeconomic trends and market risks. I believe that having a well-rounded understanding of modern finance is more important than ever, especially as markets evolve rapidly with the rise of AI.

In my projects, I enjoy **bridging traditional finance** — such as corporate finance, valuation, and capital structure — with **modern techniques** like quantitative finance and AI. I like exploring overlooked strategies, combining ideas across disciplines, and experimenting with new approaches.

This site is where I share some of these ideas and projects — personal work that reflects my own interests and curiosity. The work posted here is unrelated to any of my professional roles. If you’d like to learn more about my professional background, feel free to visit my [LinkedIn page](#).
